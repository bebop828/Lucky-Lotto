# Lucky Lotto
 A Florida Lottery Draw Game Number Generator Program

 ### **What is this?**  

This is a Python-based code to generate a random set of **Florida Lottery** draw game numbers.    

### **What can it do?** 

- Users can run this code and select from a list of Florida Lotto draw games.  
- A random range of the game's playable numbers and special ball (if required) will be generated for them to play.  
- There are 15 different draw game selections currently available. With every game choice, the user will also get information on:
    - The game's base ticket price
    - Available add-ons (if any)
    - Cut-off time to play
    - Drawing frequency
    - Draw time  
•	There is a link to the **Official Rules and Game Play** and a link to **Previous Winning Numbers**.  
•	It gives the user a choice to try another game.

### **What would I like to see it grow to?** 

When I began this project, I originally wanted it only as a trial for one game choice: Powerball. The structure for Powerball was pretty simple. I looked into a few lottery programs for different states but chose Florida.  
The code includes all the state's available draw game choices except for a game titled Cash Pop.  

**I would like to see this code expand to include:**
1.	Learn how to write in a run for checking and grabbing the official site's winning numbers file.
    - This file is frequently updated, and I want to give the user the chance to quickly check if their selected numbers have ever been drawn before.
2.	Adding many different states' individual draw games.
3.	Writing in the Florida draw game Cash Pop.


### **Final Thoughts** 
I am really new to learning what you can do with Python. I started learning about code and computer languages only at the end of February 2024.  
It is now the end of June, and I wrote this.

The inspiration to try this project came while I was completing a Certification Program through Coursera. The class involved working with Python  
to perform analysis using Pandas and NumPy. I wondered if generating a random array of numbers, as we did in class, was the basic idea behind  
the quick pick lottery choices.

I found all the specifics for the game Powerball and looked up the Official Florida Lottery site for a range of their different draw games.  
Put together a choice for each of their games and wrote in some additional information pertaining to their selection.  
I have not yet learned how to run a check for updated numbers from a site or create a way to check the generated numbers against the previous "Winning Numbers".


I have tried this and used the numbers in attempts to hit it big. As of 6/23/2024, the record for tries is:
1. Powerball - 4 purchases
    - 1 number, no prize
    - 1 number, no prize
    - Nothing
    - 1 number, no prize 
Best Outcome: 1 number $8 spent

2.	Cash 4 Life - 4 purchases
    - Won a ticket (1 number + CB)
    - Nothing
    - 1 number, no prize
    - 2 numbers, won $4 
Best Outcome: $4 winnings $8 spent

3.	Florida Lotto X - 1 purchase
    - 1 number, no prize $2 spent

$18 total spent.  
No games have I selected the add-on options for, and my best outcome is a $4 winner. Not the best return, but I really only need it to work once. You never know.  
It will make a great little analysis project for another time as I get more data.  
Have fun and try it yourself. Good Luck!!!
